# Wasteless

### Problem

Too much food is being wasted at home due to forgetfulness.

> **Al-A‘raf (The Heights) – 7:31**
>
> يَـٰبَنِىٓ ءَادَمَ خُذُوا۟ زِينَتَكُمْ عِندَ كُلِّ مَسْجِدٍۢ وَكُلُوا۟ وَٱشْرَبُوا۟ وَلَا تُسْرِفُوٓا۟ ۚ إِنَّهُۥ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُسْرِفِينَ
>
> O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes) while praying and going round the Tawâf of the Ka‘bah, <u><em>and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allah) likes not Al-Musrifûn (those who waste by extravagance).</em></u>  
> — Al-Hilali & Khan

> **Sahih Hadith**  
> Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah صلى الله عليه و سلم said, “<u><em>Allah does not like for you to waste wealth</em></u>, nor ask many unnecessary questions, nor spread gossip.”  
> Grade: Sahih — Musnad al-Bazzār 8463, authenticated by Al-Albani.
